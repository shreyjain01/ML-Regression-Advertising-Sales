This repository contains data prediction model through the Regression Algorithm. The Advertising Sales Prediction project focuses on analyzing, visualizing, and predicting sales. By examining various advertising channels like TV, Radio, and Newspaper the sales are predicted. Four regression models were successfully applied to the dataset to calculate R-squared values. Among these models, the Linear Regression model achieved the highest R-squared value on the testing data (0.9021), indicating slightly better performance in explaining the variance in the testing data compared to the other models. However, it's important to consider additional factors such as cross-validation and trade-offs when determining the best model. The choice should be based on specific goals and requirements, as well as an assessment of each model's behavior on unseen data, in order to make a more informed decision.
